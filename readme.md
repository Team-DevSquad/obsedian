## Overview

In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving threat landscape, traditional security solutions often lag behind emerging vulnerabilities. Obsidian Guard addresses this challenge by automating the scanning of source code and simulating real-world attack scenarios. This comprehensive approach helps developers secure their applications with minimal disruption to modern development workflows.

## Features

- **Static Analysis**
  - Scans Git commits for leaked credentials (API keys, access tokens, passwords) using GitLeaks and custom regex patterns.
  - Analyzes code structures and dependencies with AI-powered LLMs to uncover potential vulnerabilities.
  
- **Dynamic Analysis**
  - Executes YAML-based test cases simulating real-world attack scenarios.
  - Identifies runtime security flaws by evaluating application behavior and interactions.
  
- **Intuitive Dashboard**
  - Provides a visually engaging interface categorizing vulnerabilities by severity.
  - Offers actionable remediation suggestions to help developers quickly resolve issues.
  
- **Multi-Platform Support**
  - Seamlessly integrates into various environments such as .NET, Java, Eclipse, iOS, and more.
  - Designed for scalability and adaptability in diverse development ecosystems.

## Architecture

Obsidian Guard is built on a modular architecture comprising three main components:

1. **Backend API (apis.onsedianguard)**
   - Developed in Python using Django.
   - Integrates with PostgreSQL for data storage, Redis for caching, and Celery with Celery beat for asynchronous task processing.
   - Handles both static and dynamic security analysis.

2. **Dashboard (onsedian-dashboard)**
   - Built with Next.js and Typescript.
   - Offers an interactive interface for monitoring security findings, visualizing vulnerability data, and managing remediation efforts.

3. **Machine Learning (ML codes)**
   - Contains AI/ML models and scripts, including integration with the LLM `lily-cybersecurity-7b-v0.2`.
   - Enhances vulnerability detection using GenAI techniques.

Additional components include Docker for containerization and Minio S3 storage for handling file storage requirements.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, Celery beat
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Typescript
- **Security Scanning**: GitLeaks, custom regex patterns, AI/ML, LLM, GenAI
- **AI Integration**: lily-cybersecurity-7b-v0.2
- **DevOps**: Docker, Minio S3 storage

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

- **apis.onsedianguard**: Contains the Django-based backend API responsible for orchestrating security scans and analyses.
- **onsedian-dashboard**: Houses the Next.js/Typescript frontend code for the intuitive security dashboard.
- **ML codes**: Includes machine learning models and scripts that drive the AI-enhanced vulnerability detection mechanisms.

## Setup and Installation


### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Team-DevSquad/obsedian.git
   cd obsedian
   ```

2. **Backend**

    1. Create virtual environment 
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    cd apis.obsedianguard
    ```

    2. Install dependencies 
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    3. Run Backend
        1. Start Django Project
        ```bash
        python manage.py runserver
        ```

        2. Start Celery
        ```bash
        celery -A obsedianguard.celery worker --pool=solo -l info
        ```

        3. Start celery beat
        ```bash 
        celery -A obsedianguard beat -l info
        ```

3. **Frontend**
    1. Install dependencies
        ```bash
        cd  obsedian-dashboard
        npm i
        ```
    2. Start Dashboard
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```


## Usage
1. **Static Analysis**: Once integrated with your source code repository, Obsidian Guard continuously scans for leaked credentials and code vulnerabilities.

2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Predefined YAML-based test cases simulate real-world attack scenarios to identify runtime issues.

3. **Dashboard**: The intuitive dashboard displays categorized vulnerability reports and provides actionable remediation suggestions, enabling prompt and effective responses.
